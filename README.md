# CI-CD Application

This is a CI-CD suite which is triggered when Pull/Push request is made.
The shell scripts are executed to extract the IP of the runner which is then used to extract the country codes and subsequently the prominent languages of the country. This information is then used to generate a customized message to the user in their native language.
